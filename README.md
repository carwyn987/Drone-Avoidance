# Drone-Avoidance

**Goal:**

Build a collision detection and avoidance system capable of real-time execution in both a simulated and physical environment, with the intention of testing on a drone.

Description:

In an era where everything seems to be speeding up and getting busier, collision avoidance is becoming a greater concern. It is a topic that must be approached whether you are an auto manufacturer, air traffic controller, or even private space company. An exploration of collision detection and avoidance systems will be carried out through both the virtual and physical lens in an effort to fully grasp the scope of the field. The integration of code development, robotics, bi-directional communication, analytic geometry, and simulated environments will lead to an in depth project worthy of upholding the “Senior Honors Research Project” title.

The project will follow a high level timeline. First, research into collision detection and avoidance techniques as well as components used (dual-lens camera for depth perception). This will provide the background information and confidence needed to continue with the project. Then concurrent execution of the next two tasks: exploration of simulation practices, tools, and design, and component research for compatibility and solution practicality (ex. camera/object detection systems, precise precision and speed measurements, precise control systems for movement, etc.) will ensue. Note that the latter task will have restrictive limitations based on drone qualities (weight, power, network speed, etc). Furthermore note that I suspect these two tasks alone will take up a large portion of the first semester. The project will then switch focus to creating and training a model upon the simulated environment. This is also the stage where the components must be purchased. The project will become physical, with drone assembly, precision control training, integration with the simulated movement patterns, and interfacing/network connection objectives. Finally testing and modification for performance will be carried out, and the results - live performance visualization, presentation, and possibly a paper - will be finalized.
